# robot-arm

This repository stores all the methods I have used to control my robot arm which was made out of 4 servos, an arduino and items I found around the house. 

# The Web App Method

This code is currently for personal use, but I will be putting out more detailed instructions and changing the name of some of the files so the instructions can be easily understood. 

1. To control the arm via a web app, download the robot-arm-with-web-app folder to your computer.

2. After downloading, open your command line and navigate to the robot-arm-online-controller.

3. In the command prompt, run the following command 
npm install express

4. Start the Node.js application by entering the following into the command line
node app

5.  Connnect arduino to computer and upload the robot_arm_MK2_web_controller

6. Open your browser and enter "https://localhost:8080."
